# Bank-Customer-Attrition-Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or bank. By identifying potential churners in advance, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and minimize revenue loss. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms.

## Step Followed
### 1. Data collection: 
Obtained the customer churn dataset from Source Dataset Link.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed the comprehensive exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictive features.
### 3. Data Preprocessing:
Cleansed the data, handled categorical values, normalized the data, and addressed imbalanced data.
### 4. Model Development:
Assessed the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Selected the best-performing model for deploymet.
### 5. Model Evaluation:
Assessed the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Selected the best-performing model.
## Results and Evaluation Criterion
Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model was XGBoost which achieved an accuracy of 96% and F1-score of 89%
